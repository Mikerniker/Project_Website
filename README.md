# personal_website
Hello, 
Thanks for visiting!
This is a simple HTML and CSS website (with some Bootstrap for practice) to showcase some projects I've made.
I mainly used CSS to try to understand grid and flexbox to position the leaves.
It's been a bit of a challenge trying to understand these concepts and I still get confused.
It's a work in progress and I plan to eventually use the Flask framework to build it into a website.
